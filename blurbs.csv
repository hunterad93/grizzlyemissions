Source,Blurb,Percent Change Predicted
FERA,"Fuel and energy related activities (FERA) emissions occur upstream from the scope 1 direct combustion of a fuel or generation of energy. This includes indirect emissions related to fuel use such as refinement, production, transportation etc.",0.901932171921189
Commuting,"Commuting has been a difficult emissions source to measure in the past. In 2021 a survey was conducted to assess commuting habits of campus affiliates, and this change in emissions assessment methodology is the reason that commuting emissions appear far higher in recent years.",0.4211064264724676
T&D Losses,"T&D losses, or Transmission and Distribution losses, represent the energy lost during the transmission of electricity from power generation sources to end-users due to factors like resistance and inefficiencies in the electrical grid. We assume that we lose about 5% of our electricity through these inefficiencies.",-0.2962636501640488
Landfill Waste,Landfill waste generates greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions when organic materials like food and yard waste decompose in anaerobic conditions. Managing landfill waste responsibly is crucial to reduce these harmful emissions.,-1.912544595506705
Co-gen Plant,The campus combined heat and power plant is vital for heating the campus through cold Missoula winters. It is the largest source of emissions for the University. Co-gen emissions have decreased by 8.7% in the last decade despite the campus growing by 3.6%.,0.9019133731787224
Fertilizer,"Fertilizer usage contributes to emissions when nitrogen-based fertilizers release nitrous oxide, a potent greenhouse gas, during application and as they break down in soil. Sustainable fertilizer practices are essential to mitigate these emissions.",-15.37634408602151
University Fleet,The university fleet emissions are calculated from gas and diesel purchases made by the university. The last few years have seen an increase in gas and diesel usage.,-4.577732533802939
Purchased Electricity,Purchased electricity related emissions have decreased meaningfully over recent years. Actual electricity use has remained fairly constant with a growing campus while the production of electricity has become more efficient and less emissions-intense.,-0.2960902926370997
Propane & Natural Gas,"Propane and natural gas (outside of NG used to power the CHP plant) are a relatively small contributor to emissions. A large portion of these emissions are related to the activities of remote campus locations like the Flathead Lake Biostation,  Lubrecht Forest, and Bandy Ranch.",-3.681467583906602
Air Travel,"Air travel emissions are primarily driven by the business travel of faculty and staff as well as the travel of athletics teams. This emissions source has generally been the second or third largest driver of overall emissions. A notable drop in 2021 is due to COVID travel restrictions. It is also worth noting that due to flights being less occupied in the years 2020 and 2021, the impact of air travel during these times was significantly higher. Reducing air travel is perhaps the most effective way for UM to decrease its footprint.",-10.113272771123079
Bus Travel,Bus travel represents a relatively small portion of the overall emissions footprint.,-4.457364341085271
